        'The Rambler series of drinkware is the first line of YETIs you can fit in your hand. And, yeah, we over-engineered them to be virtually indestructible and keep your drink as cold (or hot) as science allows. With 18/8 stainless steel construction, double-wall vacuum insulation, and No Sweat™ Design, they’re perfect for the deer lease, cleaning table, or just the times in between your outdoor adventures.',
        'The Hopper was built for those adventures where you just want to grab your gear and go. It’s the original 100% leakproof, ice-for-days portable cooler. And because we used materials found in things like survival suits, it’s also tough as nails. The Hopper is made in sizes to fit any adventure, whether that’s on a wild river in a kayak or a floatplane trip to a remote salmon stream.',
        'Meet the original YETI®. The Tundra was born when we took our frustrations with cheap coolers and over-engineered the hell out of them. We ended up creating a whole new category of coolers with legendary toughness and ice retention. The Tundra comes in enough sizes for wilderness expeditions, hunting excursions, fishing trips, tailgating, or any outdoor adventure.'
